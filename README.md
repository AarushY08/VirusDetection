Tested different algorithms to see which one is more accurate


Decision Tree Evaluation:

Accuracy: 98.79%

Confusion Matrix:

[[19120   185]

[  147  8037]]

Random Forest Evaluation:

Accuracy: 99.19%

Confusion Matrix:

[[19184   121]

[  102  8082]]

Concluding that Random Forest generalizes better on this dataset.
